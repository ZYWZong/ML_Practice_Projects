# Project: SkimLit PubMed abstract reader

## Objective

Build a neural network model that beats my best baseline model (built using classic statistical learning methodds) on `accuracy` while maintaining at least $70$% on `precision`, `recall`, and `F-1` scores. The data used for this project are from *PubMed* (see [notebook 00](https://github.com/ZYWZong/ML_Practice_Projects/blob/e60a659556b3f231576d4f5c81e0fd0e491ba57e/SkimLit_project_practice/SkimLit_data_preprocessing_and_baseline_model_00.ipynb) for details).
