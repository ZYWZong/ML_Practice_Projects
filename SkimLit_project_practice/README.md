# NLP Project 01: SkimLit PubMed sentence classifier

## Objective

This project is to classify sentences of an abstract into five categories of `OBJECTIVE`, `METHODS`, `RESULTS`, `BACKGROUND`, and `CONCLUSIONS`. The data are from `PubMed` (see [notebook 00](https://github.com/ZYWZong/ML_Practice_Projects/blob/e60a659556b3f231576d4f5c81e0fd0e491ba57e/SkimLit_project_practice/SkimLit_data_preprocessing_and_baseline_model_00.ipynb) for details about the dataset). The goal is to build a neural network model that beats my best baseline model (built using classic statistical learning methodds) on `accuracy` while maintaining at least $70$% on `precision`, `recall`, and `F-1` scores.
